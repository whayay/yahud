Merge the resource folder of one of the options with your resource folder in /tf/custom/yourfoldername/resource to enable captions. 

Their location and their behaviour can be customized in /scripts/hudlayout.res.

If the captions don't show up try restarting the game or using the "closecaption 1" command in console.

You can find the original captions (they include captions for engineer buildings for example) here: https://code.google.com/p/tf2captions/
